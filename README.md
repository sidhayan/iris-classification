## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate a simple yet effective machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species of iris flowers.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:
